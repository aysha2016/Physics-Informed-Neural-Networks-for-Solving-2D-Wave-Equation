# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for 2D Wave Equation

This repository provides a simple implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) designed to solve the 2D wave equation using deep learning. The model incorporates physical constraints directly into the loss function, allowing it to learn solutions that satisfy both data-driven and physics-based principles.

### Contents:
1. **Model**: A simple feedforward neural network (FNN) architecture used to approximate the solution to the 2D wave equation.
2. **Loss Function**: A physics-informed loss function that combines traditional data loss and physics-based constraints (from the wave equation).
3. **Training Script**: A script to train the model using synthetic data generated from the wave equation.
4. **Dataset Generation**: Code to generate synthetic wave data, which can be used for training the network.

## Problem Overview

The wave equation governs the propagation of waves, such as sound waves, light waves, and water waves. In 2D, it can be written as:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( u(x, y, t) \) is the wave function (e.g., displacement of the wave at coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) at time \(t\)),
- \( c \) is the wave speed.

The PINN framework is designed to learn the wave's solution while respecting the physics of the wave equation.

## Features

- **PINN Model**: The model architecture consists of fully connected layers (Feedforward Neural Network) with ReLU activations.
- **Wave Equation Loss**: The custom loss function enforces the wave equation constraints during training.
- **Synthetic Data**: The training data is generated by solving the wave equation using a numerical solver.
- **GPU Support**: The model training is compatible with GPUs for faster computation.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following packages installed:
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. **Directory Structure**:
    ```
    ├── models/
    │   └── model.py            # The neural network model definition
    ├── utils/
    │   └── losses.py           # Physics-informed loss functions
    ├── train.py                # Script to train the model

    └── README.md               # This file
    ```

## Training the Model

To train the PINN model for the 2D wave equation:

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
    Run `data_generation.py` to generate training data for the 2D wave equation.
    ```bash
    python data_generation.py
    ```

2. **Train the Model**:
    Run `train.py` to start training the model.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

The training script will:
- Load the data generated from the 2D wave equation.
- Train the neural network using both the data loss (from synthetic wave solutions) and the physics-informed loss (from the wave equation PDE).
- Save the trained model to `pinn_wave_model.pth`.
